# My Data Science Guide

This is a guide that I created to self-teach data science and machine learning. There are tons of resources online, but I feel a consolidated and complete guide will help me learn better. I will use Jupyter Notebooks to run code in Python and R. Here is the curriculum, which will be updated as material gets added:

* Python 3
  - Data Types and Structures
  - Logic and Loops
  - Methods, Objects, and Classes
  - Advanced Python
* R for Data Science
* Numpy
* Pandas
  - Data Frames
  - Data Manipulation
  - Pivot Tables
* Matplotlib
* Scikit Learn
* Tensorflow

*More to come...*
