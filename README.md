# Harish's Data Science Guide

This is a guide that I created to self-teach data science and machine learning. I will use Jupyter Notebooks to run code in Python (and eventually, R). Here is the curriculum, which will be updated as material gets added:

* Python 3
  - Data Types and Structures
  - Logic and Loops
  - Methods, Objects, and Classes
  - Advanced Python
* R for Data Science
* Numpy
* Pandas
  - DataFrames
* Matplotlib

*More to come...*
